I am a PhD candidate in Material Science and Engineering at Cornell University working with [Prof. Mike Thompson](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/michael-thompson). My research focuses on using artificial intelligent and machine learning methods, especially [active learning](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.abg4930), to accelerate material discovery and developing methods for assisting autonomous high-throughput experiment. I am currently looking for a summer internship in 2023 on AI research.
